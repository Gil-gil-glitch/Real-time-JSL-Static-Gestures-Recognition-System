# Real-time-JSL-Static-Gestures-Recognition-System

### Project Title and Description

This is the earliest iteration of my team's machine learning-based recognition system for identifying static Japanese Sign Language (JSL) gestures using hand tracking data. The project aims to improve acessibility technologies for the JSL community by providing a system that recongizes getures with high accuracy and adapability.
